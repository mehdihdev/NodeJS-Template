# NodeJS Template ðŸŽ¨

I got lazy of running `npm init` 1000x times, so I made a template.

## Running the App

Clone the repo, then find the `.envexample` file and change the name to `.env`. Change the `port` and any other variables in the file to your liking, then in the main directory run:
```
npm install && npm start
```

and enjoy!
